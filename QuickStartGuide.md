# Quick Start Guide
This document is intended to provide a minimal guide to setting up a test instance and have try. We want you to be successful in as short a time as possible.

## Creating a MogileFS cluster for test 

We have two options here: 
* [Using docker to deploy MogileFS](InstallOnDocker.md) 
* [Deploying MogileFS manually](InstallForTest.md)

If you feel comfortable with docker, we recommend the first one. Alternatively, you can install it manually by following the second option.
 
## Have fun with your first MogileFS cluster 

After you deploy MogileFS by following steps above, follow the [command line usage](CommandlineUsage.md) guide to upload/fetch/delete files to/from MogileFS.

## Further Reading
If you would like a more detailed walkthrough with instructions for installing using different methods, e.g., virtual machines, EC2 and baremetal and different distributions, then have a look at the [Install Guide](InstallHowTo.md).
