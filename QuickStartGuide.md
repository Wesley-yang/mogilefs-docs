This document is intended to provide a step-by-step guide to setting up a test instance and have try.

# Step 1: Creating a MogileFS Test Setup 

First of all, you should create a MogileFS setup for test. We recommand the following two options: 
* [Create a MogileFS setup in the container's way](InstallOnDocker.md) 
* [Creating a MogileFS test setup manually](InstallForTest.md)

Choose one whatever you like.

If you would like a more detailed walkthrough with instructions for installing using different methods (in local virtual machines, EC2 and baremetal) and different distributions, then have a look at the Install guide.

# Step 2: Try to play with MogileFS 

You can use build-in command line tools to interact with MogileFS, e.g., upload/fetch/delete files. Please read the following guide:

[Play with the commandline tools](CommandlineUsage.md)
